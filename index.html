        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by to find out about our program. We are a small in-home Mother/Daughter/Family program and strive to breed healthy puppies with amazing temperaments... The perfect family pet!</p>
        <p>Our journey started in 2012 with our first little of golden retrievers and we instantly fell in love. It has since expanded.
        While the majority of our puppies are goldendoodles, we occassionally still have golden retrievers and have recently added bernedoodles and aussiedoodles for future litters.</p>
        <p>Susan (mother) and Hannah (daughter) both have degrees from The Ohio State University in Animal Science and love learning about learning about our dogs, from a breeding and scientific aspect to the social/emotional side of the business.
        We feel that our knowledge and passion for breeding and animal welfare makes this a match made in heaven! I think all of our puppy families will agree that we are caring and compassionate breeders who place the needs of our dogs above all else!</p>
