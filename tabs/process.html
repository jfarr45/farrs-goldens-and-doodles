        <h2>How are our puppies raised?</h2>
        <p>We want the best for our puppies and for the families who choose a puppy from FGD! That is why we are continuously researching the best methods involvd. Starting them off on the right foot can lead to a more confident and happy dog.
        From days 3-16, all puppies are raise with Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS) and Early Scent Introduction
        Once they complete that, they have a series of items, sights, sounds, and touches they are exposed to throughout their time at our home. Many of our puppies have continued to become Service or Therapy Dogs.
        We keep them in our home and we each have facilities with play areas for the puppies as they get older and need more room to continue their enrichment.</p>

        <h2>The Puppy Process</h2>
            <p>Once you have decided that you would like a puppy from FGD, you can fill out our contact list. We will contact you for a confirmation and add you to our list. We keep names on a master list and when we get ready to breed for a litter that matches your preferences, we will take <b>six</b> deposits per litter and collect a $200 non-refundable deposit.
            Upon their arrival, we will contact the next people on the list for any remaining spots available. Around 6 weeks of age, we will begin the puppy picking process and puppies will go home at 8 weeks of age. While in our care, they receive the best possible care so they will be well-adjusted.</p>
